# Programming for Data Analysis - Project 2<br>

### Project Description:<br>

This project will investigate the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset. With a focus on the following:

Undertake an analysis/review of the dataset and present an overview and background.
Provide a literature review on classifiers which have been applied to the dataset and compare their performance.
Present a statistical analysis of the dataset.
Using a range of machine learning algorithms, train a set of classifiers on the dataset (using SKLearn etc.) and present classification performance results. Detail your rationale for the parameter selections you made while training the classifiers.
Compare, contrast and critique your results with reference to the literature.
Discuss and investigate how the dataset could be extended â€“ using data synthesis of new tumour datapoints.
